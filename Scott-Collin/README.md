Lab 10: Functional Programming

**Author**: Scott and Collin
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application populates a statistics page using data gathered from the central JSON data file. It creates new properties to hold data and then pushes them into a handlebars template on admin.html.

## Getting Started
The user must write functions that map, filter and reduce raw json data in order to produce meaningful statistics. The user must then successfully link these statistics into a handlebars template.

## Architecture
This application uses JSON, handlebars, a variety of node.js modules, JQuery.

## Change Log
